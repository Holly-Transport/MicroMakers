# MicroMakers Afterschool Coding Club

Dear MicroMakers,

I am so honored and delighted to have this opportunity to work with and learn from you, while we solve challenges by building nifty gadgets. 

## What We'll Do
In our Club, we will learn the basic principles of physical computing – creating devices that use sensors to collect information, process this information, and then perform an action. For example, a physical computing project may involve using sensors to detect soil moisture, sending the data to a processer to determine whether the soil is too dry, and then activating a motor to pump water into the soil. Physical computing involves interacting with the physical world, in addition to a screen, making learning to code more fun and understandable. 

We will learn about physical computing using the micro:bit – a microcontroller (a pocket-sized computer) developed by the British Broadcasting Company (BBC) for teaching children how to code. The micro:bit has an LED light display, buttons, sensors, and many input/output features that are programmable using a variety of languages. To get started, we will be using Microsoft MakeCode, a visual “drag and drop” programming language designed for kids. Later, as things really get cooking, we'll dive into making games with Scratch -- the gold-standard for visual programming languages -- using our micro:bits as game controllers (!). For fun, we'll also play with Scrappy Circuits and Python, just to keep everyone on their toes. 

In MicroMakers, by making new gadgets during every meet up, we will cover the following concepts:

 - Computer inputs (especially sensors), outputs, and processors
 - Computer memory
 - Electric circuits
 - Programming fundamentals (variables and constants, functions, loops, logic, and math)
 - The “making” process (problem statement, solution design, testing and iteration, documentation, and dissemination)
 
 ## Materials
 In this open-source repository, you will find:
 
 - Lab Notebook with code examples, badge record keeper, and spaces for your notes
 - Meetup slides
 - Goodies, like grid paper, coding cards, and more
 - Link to our excellent coding playlist, here: [playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1I0ntR8Bl7KESXRI7BwELo?si=85ca48f2c6a344ec)

Thank you again -- I cannot wait to see the wonderful inventions you will make!

❤️,
<br>
Ms. Holly

P.S. If you are just checking out our repo and would like to use these materials for your own coding club, that would be fabulous! Pretty please let me know how it goes and whether you have ideas on how we can make the program even better ❤️
